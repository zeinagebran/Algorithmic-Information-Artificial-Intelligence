This study investigates how data redundancy and randomness affect compressibility and complexity, quantified through compression ratios and entropy. The analysis spans structured datasets like checkerboards and text data, comparing their behavior across these metrics.
In cloud computing and data centers, understanding these relationships helps in implementing better data compression techniques that can reduce physical storage requirements and associated costs, while also improving the speed of data access and processing.
